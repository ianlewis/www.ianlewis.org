Recently I've been reading Will Larsen's book
[Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track](https://staffeng.com/).
I first encountered Will on Twitter back when he wasn't as well known. He was a
tech manager with a connection to Japan because he had worked in the JET program
for a year. He barely mentions it now, but it was something he talked about much
more in the past.

Along with that I've been reading some of his blog posts and others he's linked
to in trying to get a clearer understanding about where I should go from here
with my career. I'm getting older now but I'd like to work on at least one more
significant project before I retire.

So, with that said, today's weekly reading will focus on career growth as a
software engineer.

- [Work on what matters](https://lethain.com/work-on-what-matters/) -- _Will Larsen_

    This post is present almost entirely word-for-word in the _Staff Engineer_.
    The main point is that you should make sure to choose projects that are
    impactful and important to the company you're working for. Avoid "snacking"
    on easy projects that aren't the most pressing. Avoid "preening" by working
    on projects that are visible but not very impactful. Don't "chase ghosts" by
    pushing strategy changes that misunderstand current challenges.

    One thing that the post mentions is that you should choose projects where
    there is room for your contribution rather than piling on to leadership's
    top priority. I think there are positives and negatives to either approach
    but it's something to keep in mind.

- [A forty-year career](https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/) -- _Will Larsen_

    This post mentions several themes to focus on during your career. The themes
    are Pace, People, Prestige, Profit, and Learning. Each will be more helpful
    at different stages in your career and the graphic at the top is a good
    illustration of this.

    Learning is going to be especially helpful early on. Focusing on People is
    helpful mid-career. Profit and Pace are helpful most in your later career.

    Here "Profit" is meant as your own financial stability rather than company
    profit. I think you could easily think of the latter as well and it would be
    roughly the same in the graphic. Doing things that improve revenue or reduce
    costs will always have easy visibility and be helpful in career growth.

    I'm not actually sure that focusing on your financial stability early in
    your career is especially important, but you'll at least want to have an eye
    on it. In either case, it will be helpful to you no matter what stage in
    your career.

- [The Engineer/Manager Pendulum](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/) -- _Charity Majors_

    Charity is the co-founder and CTO of Honeycomb. Here she talks about
    swinging back and forth between being a manager and IC engineer during the
    course of your career.

    I think it might be useful to have another skill that you're known for in
    addition to engineering. But I'm not sure it's a great idea to go back and
    forth between two different job titles or career tracks.

    Maybe engineering to engineering management and back is okay, but I myself
    went to work in Developer Relations before coming back to engineering and
    I'm honestly not sure if it helped me. I think it hurt me in terms of skill
    set. I find that I need to establish myself again technically, and it's been
    hard to do that.

    Overall, not a huge fan of this post, but it does make some good points.

- [How to achieve career growth: opportunities, skills & sponsors](https://yenkel.dev/posts/how-to-achieve-career-growth-opportunities-skills-sponsors) -- _Damian Schenkelman_

    This is a post that Will linked to in one of his posts. I found that it was
    a good description of "sponsorship" and how it can impact your career. The
    post talks about sponsorship mostly from the perspective of the one being
    sponsored. One quote that he mentions is from an
    [article on Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviatemin/2016/04/04/what-theyre-saying-about-you-when-youre-not-in-the-room-and-what-you-can-do-to-influence-it/):

    > The biggest decisions about your career are often made when you’re not in
    > the room.

    This is a good point in that it recognizes that other people can have a
    strong impact on your career by deciding what opportunities to offer you.

    Damian expands on this and presents a growth model through the lens of
    systems design or [systems thinking](https://lethain.com/systems-thinking/).
    In that model you increase available opportunities by improving your visible
    skills and cultivating sponsors. He has a simple, but useful diagram to
    illustrate it.
