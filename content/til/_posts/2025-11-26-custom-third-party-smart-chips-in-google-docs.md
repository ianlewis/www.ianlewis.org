Google Docs and Google Sheets have a native feature called "[smart
chips](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/10710316?hl=en)". You can type
"@", search for, and add links to people, files, events, etc.

Apparently Google Docs also allows you to create [custom third-party smart
chips](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/guides/preview-links-smart-chips)
using App Script. This seems like it would be really useful for private
third-party links.

I'm really surprised that someone hasn't written a good script for GitHub links
that includes support for private repositories. I searched around but I couldn't
find anything. I think it would be super useful for companies that use Google
Docs and GitHub.
