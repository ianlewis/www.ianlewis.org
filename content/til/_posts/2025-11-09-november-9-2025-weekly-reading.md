# Productivity

- [Steal the Productivity System I Taught to 6,642 Googlers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO9GLC2iKy8) -- _Jeff Su_

    The video is a bit clicé and Jeff does goes hard into promoting Google
    Workspace tools but some of the ideas are interesting.

    Jeff suggests a Capture, Organize, Review, Engage system for capturing and
    handling tasks. Capture the task and organize it with a due date, or tag in
    a task app. Next review to make sure the task is still relevant, and
    schedule time to do it. Finally, actually engage and do the task.

    He says he reviews new tasks three times a day but that seems excessive.
    This method also seems like it would work well for someone in his field of
    marketing where there are lots of small tasks to handle. I think this system
    would make it easy for someone to get bogged down in small tasks and lose
    focus of the big picture and larger projects.

    It also seems like it would be easy to accumulate way more tasks than you
    could actually do and get bogged down in prioritizing them. For someone
    early in their career this might work, but for someone more senior I think
    it would be better to focus strategically on a smaller number of high impact
    tasks.

- [How To Force Your Brain To Be Motivated (when you don’t feel like it)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK5LM6PVi0U) -- _Daniel Pink_

    Daniel Pink gives some brain hacks for getting motivated to do tasks. This
    is helpful for folks with ADD, like myself, who struggle with
    procrastination or motivation.

    Much of it is similar to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques like
    cognitive reframing. For example, reframing from having extrinsic motivation
    to intrinsic motivation. Instead of thinking "I have to do this task to get
    a reward" think "I want to do this task because it aligns with my values".

    Reframing is often easier said than done though. It can be hard to break out
    of a negative mindset.
