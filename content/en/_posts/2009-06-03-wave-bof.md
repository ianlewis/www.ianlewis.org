I attended the [Google Wave BOF](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/a2c/20090602/1243954329)
(Birds of a Feather). It was a good time for folks with
[Google Wave](http://wave.google.com/) accounts to show it off to folks who
can't sign into it yet. It originally was going to be about 25 people but due to
popular demand the location had to be moved, and it went up to about 40 people.
Lots of folks were interested in hearing about Google Wave as a new
collaborative platform.

[id:a2c](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/a2c/) mentioned my `debuggy` robot that I created
to show events as they get fired by Google Wave. Below is me showing off
`debuggy` at the Googleplex. I got a very tepid response from the folks at the
hackathon. I seemed to get a better response from people at the BOF. I'll talk
more about `debuggy` in a later post.

As it is, currently it was hard for most people to visualize how they would use
the tool for daily work but everyone seemed interested in the possibilities and
it was received warmly. Looking forward to future releases of Google Wave!
