The first version of the [Disqus plugin](http://manual.b2evolution.net/Plugins/disqus_plugin) has been released!

The Disqus plugin allows you to use comments from the social commenting website
Disqus. It embeds javascript to show comments when viewing a particular blog
post and shows how many comments a post has when viewing a blog post list. Find
out more about what Disqus does on the
[Disqus website](http://www.disqus.com/docs/about/). Read more about the plugin
on the
[`disqus_plugin` plugin page](http://manual.b2evolution.net/Plugins/disqus_plugin).
