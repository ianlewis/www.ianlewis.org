There is a small but growing Python community in Japan. Many people, even some
of those Python enthusiasts who living in Japan, are unaware of this and don't
know who any of these people are. There are a lot of reasons for this but the
number one reason is probably the large language barrier between Japanese
speakers and non-Japanese speakers. Currently it can be kind of hard to know
who's interested in what, or who the go-to person is for a particular topic. I
think that's a shame and that there should be more communication going on with
the community in Japan and the wider Python community, and a lot of the Japanese
community leaders don't get the kind of credit or publicity they deserve outside
of Asia. I hope to help solve that problem with this blog post by providing a
kind of who's who of Japanese Python community members.

## Atsuo Ishimoto

Atsuo is the owner of the [python.jp](http://python.jp/) domain name and one of
the original moderators of the python.jp mailing list. He is a long time Python
user and community leader.

## Atsushi Shibata

Atsushi Shibata is probably the most well known community leader in Japan. He
wrote the wildly popular "Minna no Python" (Everyone's Python) and led in
moderating the python.jp mailing list for many years.

## Ryosuke Nakai (voluntas)

Ryosuke is the organizer of Python Onsen (PySpa) and Python Developers Festa
(PyFes). Both are popular Python community events. Python Onsen is an
weekend-long event where fellow Python enthusiasts travel to a Japanese Ryokan
and spend the weekend coding and goofing off. PyFes is a day long event where
members give tutorials and talks on Python.

## Manabu Terada (terapyon)

Manabu is the chair of the PyCon JP management team, and long-time Plone
community leader. Manabu has been indispensable as the PyCon JP chair in doing
the nitty-gritty organizing of the conference. A job I do not envy. He also runs
his own development/consulting company focusing on Plone and Python development.

Japan. He has also been instrumental in organizing PyCon JP and in organizing
the Python mini-hackathon event.

indoor [bouldering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering) event for Python
community members. Takanori is also highly involved with PyCon JP and the Python
