I am a Developer Advocate working for
[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) in Tokyo, Japan. My interests are in
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Go](http://golang.org/), [Python](http://www.python.org/),
and, of course, [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/). I
am currently a contributer to [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/) and
various other container runtime and security related projects.

I moved to Tokyo in 2006 and have been working as a web developer. I previously
did development using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and
[Python](https://www.python.org/) but have experience developing in Java as
well as mobile application development.

I have passed the
[JLPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test) N1. I
like to think my Japanese is pretty good but still always learning.

I was a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/experts/) from
2011 to 2014. I specialized in Google's cloud offerings, especially the Python
language version of [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/).

I was a founder, Vice Chair of the Board (2013-2019), and media team lead
(2014) for the [PyCon JP](https://www.pycon.jp/) conference.
