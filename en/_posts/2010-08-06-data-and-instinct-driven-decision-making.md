I just read a piece called [We Are All Talk Radio
Hosts](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/08/we-are-all-talk-radio-hosts/)
which mentions some studies saying that the more we humans think about
things, the more we make bad decisions. The rationale is that we try to
come up with reasons why we like or dislike something rather than simply
choosing it based on our experience. It extends to almost all of our
choices from jams, to cars, to apartments.

This sort of phenomenon is why you can't ask people what they want. They
don't know. Even if they think they know, they'll really tell you
something they don't really want or need. In trying to come up with why
they want a particular thing humans tend to introduce a lot of factors
that don't really matter to them when they come up with their reasoning.
You have to instead observe them and identify problems without asking
and come up with clever solutions that solve those problems. The best
way to do this is by conducting experiments and collecting and analyzing
data.

Human minds are irrational, emotional, and not at all designed to solve
the complex rational problems that we face in the modern world. The
point is that you cannot even trust yourself. You can't trust your own
thoughts, feelings, emotions, and wants. They are most likely wrong and
leading you down a path that where you come up with the wrong answer or
create bad solutions. Scientists know this and thus devised the
scientific theory to avoid the problem of introducing personal bias.

It's time everyone, from marketing people to web programmers used a bit
more science to solve problems instead of asking people things (i.e.
stop sending me those fucking surveys)
