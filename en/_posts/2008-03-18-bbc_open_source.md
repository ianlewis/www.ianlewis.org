I took a look at the [Google](http://www.google.com/ "Google") summer of code [mentoring organizations for 2008](http://code.google.com/soc/2008) and was surprised to see BBC research listed. They were probably previous participants but it seems that BBC maintains a number of open source projects on their [open source page](http://www.bbc.co.uk/opensource/). The most notable ones seem to be the ones that they are going to use the interns for, [Kamaelia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/opensource/projects/kamaelia/), which is apparently a test system for large scale media distribution, and [Dirac](http://www.bbc.co.uk/opensource/projects/dirac/), an open source video codec. All in all, some pretty cool stuff.
