I took a look at the <a href="http://www.google.com/" title="Google">Google</a> summer of code <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008">mentoring organizations for 2008</a> and was surprised to see BBC research listed. They were probably previous participants but it seems that BBC maintains a number of open source projects on their <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/opensource/">open source page</a>. The most notable ones seem to be the ones that they are going to use the interns for, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/opensource/projects/kamaelia/">Kamaelia</a>, which is apparently a test system for large scale media distribution, and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/opensource/projects/dirac/">Dirac</a>, an open source video codec. All in all, some pretty cool stuff.
