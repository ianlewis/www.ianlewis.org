Is it just me or has the behavior of cp in linux distributions changed
recently? cp is non-interactive by default so a lot of people, myself included,
set an alias to include the -i flag so that cp was interactive by default.

```bash
alias cp=cp -i
```

But I used to enjoy the fact that if I set this alias it would prompt me when
overwriting files but if there was a situation where I wanted it to be
non-interactive I could do that by specifying -f. Basically, the last -i or -f
would win. I want interative by default but the ability to specify
non-interactive at my discretion.

However, recently or so, I noticed that several linux distributions include a
cp that if you specify a cp -i alias you cannot specify -f to use
non-interactive mode. The -f is ignored or at least doesn't cancel out the -i.
Perhaps there is another way do to what I want but I'm unaware of it at the
moment. Currently I have to remove the alias, do the non-interactive copy, and
then reinstate the alias. Super annoying.

**Update:** You can bypass an alias by putting quotes around the command like so,

```shell
"cp" source destination
```
