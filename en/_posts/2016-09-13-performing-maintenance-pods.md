Kubernetes includes a feature called [services](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/) which serve as a kind of load balancer for pods. When pods misbehave or otherwise stop working, sometimes you'll want to remove the pod from the service without killing the pod.

## Services & Endpoints

Each service has a list of endpoints for the service which correspond to the pods for that service. This list of endpoints is updated automatically with the IPs and ports for the pods based on a label selector defined on the service. This allows the service to be loosely coupled to the pods themselves. You can see the selector pattern used in many other kubernetes components like [Deployments](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/deployments/) and [ReplicaSets](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/replicasets/).

[<img alt="Service Endpoints" title="Service Endpoints" class="align-center" src="/assets/images/753/endpoints.png">](/assets/images/753/endpoints.png)

Because the list of endpoints is updated automatically based on the label selector, we take take misbehaving pods off of the endpoints for debugging and maintenance by updating the labels on the pod so that it doesn't match the selector. In order for us to update a service selector so that pods can be removed from it we will need to have a selector that can be easily updated. In order to do that we'll add a label that we can toggle to take any of our pods out of service.

Let's create a Deployment with an `enabled` label:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: nginx
spec:
    template:
        metadata:
            labels:
                name: nginx
                enabled: "true"
        spec:
            containers:
                - name: nginx
                  image: nginx
```

In our service we will use these labels in our selector:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
    labels:
        name: nginx
    name: nginx
spec:
    ports:
        - name: http
          port: 80
          targetPort: 80
    selector:
        name: nginx
        enabled: "true"
```

After we create our deployment and service we would have some pods running.

```shell
$ kubectl get pods nginx
NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-1802606028-1posu   1/1       Running   0          27s
nginx-1802606028-yjoty   1/1       Running   0          27s

```

We can list the pod endpoints here too.

```shell
$ kubectl get endpoints nginx
NAME      ENDPOINTS                   AGE
nginx     10.40.3.6:80,10.40.3.7:80   22m
```

Let's take the pod `nginx-1802606028-1posu` out for maintenance. First let's note it's pod IP.

```shell
$ kubectl get pods -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.metadata.name=="nginx-1802606028-1posu")].status.podIP}'
10.40.3.7
```

Now, to put the pod under maintenance we can change the `enabled` label to something other than `"true"`. We need to pass the `--overwrite` flag to update an existing label.

```shell
$ kubectl label pod nginx-1802606028-1posu enabled=false --overwrite
pod "nginx-1802606028-1posu" labeled
```

If we check the endpoints again we would notice that we still have two endpoints. This is because the deployment has recognized based on it's own selector that it should start another pod.

```shell
$ kubectl get pods --show-labels
NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       LABELS
nginx-1802606028-1posu   1/1       Running   0          5m        enabled=false,name=nginx,pod-template-hash=1802606028
nginx-1802606028-fl33g   1/1       Running   0          2m        enabled=true,name=nginx,pod-template-hash=1802606028
nginx-1802606028-yjoty   1/1       Running   0          5m        enabled=true,name=nginx,pod-template-hash=1802606028
```

We can notice here that our pod under maintenance is no longer in the endpoints.

```shell
$ kubectl get endpoints
NAME      ENDPOINTS                   AGE
nginx     10.40.3.6:80,10.40.3.8:80   25m
```

We can now do maintenance on our pod.

## Performing Maintenance

How you perform maintenance on your pod will be highly application specific so I won't go into it a whole lot here. However, Kubernetes provides a few features that make it easy to connect to applications running in your cluster so I'll mention those briefly.

### kubectl attach

You can attach to an running pod in order to send it data on stdin and get debugging info on stdout. This is great if your process allows you to send it commands on stdin to get info on it's internal state. Some containers however, don't create a TTY. You will be able to see stdout but this is very close to just using `kubectl logs`.

```shell
$ kubectl attach nginx-1802606028-1posu -it
Unable to use a TTY - container nginx did not allocate one
127.0.0.1 - - [13/Sep/2016:02:51:06 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 612 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/53.0.2785.101 Safari/537.36" "-"
2016/09/13 02:51:07 [error] 5#5: *1 open() "/usr/share/nginx/html/favicon.ico" failed (2: No such file or directory), client: 127.0.0.1, server: localhost, request: "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1", host: "localhost:8000", referrer: "http://localhost:8000/"
127.0.0.1 - - [13/Sep/2016:02:51:07 +0000] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 571 "http://localhost:8000/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/53.0.2785.101 Safari/537.36" "-"
```

### kubectl exec

`kubectl exec` allows you to execute a command in a container. You can use this to do any number of things, but perhaps you might use it to send a signal to a process in the container.

```shell
kubectl exec nginx-1802606028-1posu -- killall -HUP nginx
```

Or you could just start up a bash shell if bash is installed.

```shell
kubectl exec nginx-1802606028-1posu -ti -- bash -il
```

### kubectl port-forward

Another useful feature is port forwarding. We can use this to forward a local port to our pod so we can send it requests and see how it responds.

```shell
$ kubectl port-forward nginx-1802606028-1posu 8000:80
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8000 -> 80
Forwarding from [::1]:8000 -> 80
```

After that we can send it requests from another terminal.

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:8000/
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
<style>
    body {
        width: 35em;
        margin: 0 auto;
        font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
    }
</style>
</head>
<body>

```

## Wrap up

Label selectors make it easy to take pods out for maintenance. There are some things you need to keep in mind though.

### Services and Deployments

Because Services and Deployments often both use label selectors it is possible to take a pod out for maintenance but leave it as part of the Deployment. This is fine in many circumstances, but if you have a Deployment with a [HorizontalPodAutoscaler](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/horizontal-pod-autoscaling/), the Deployment could scale down and delete your pod at any time. Also, while a single pod taken out of service isn't much, it still may have a performance impact on your application. For these reasons I would suggest taking it out of the Deployment as well and have the Deployment start up a replacement pod.

### Putting Pods back into Service

After we are done maintenance on our pod we may want to put it back into the service. You can do this by updating the label again to match the service selector.

```shell
$ kubectl label pod nginx-1802606028-1posu enabled=true --overwrite
pod "nginx-1802606028-1posu" labeled
```

This is great if your pod is part of a [PetSet](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/petset/) or restarting it is hard. But if we are using Deployments, and since the pod was acting flaky to begin with, and pods in a Deployment are by definition replaceable, we should probably just delete the pod. Even if we added it back to the Deployment, the Deployment would notice that it has one too many pods and delete one anyway.

If you keep these things in mind, finding out why a particular pod was acting up in production can be a _relatively_ smooth experience.
