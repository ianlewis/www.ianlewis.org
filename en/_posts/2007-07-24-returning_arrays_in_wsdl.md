This week I've been working on setting up several web service for a
project I'm working on for work. Because we are creating these web
services from scratch we had to start by creating a
[WSDL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSDL) file to describe the web
service and it's functions.

WSDL is a type of xml document that describes the inputs and outputs
from a web service. This can be done using a number of ways but in my
case I'm using [SOAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) so I described
my inputs and outputs using [XML Schema](http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema).

WSDL I found a number of documents helpful. [Forthought
Inc.](http://fourthought.com/)'s Uche Ogbuji always seems to write good
articles and [Using WSDL in SOAP
applications](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-soap/?dwzone=ws)
no exception. Also, examining existing documents that are publicly
available was also a big help. Such as this example [Stock
Quote](http://www.webservicex.net/stockquote.asmx?WSDL) web service. Or
the Google [SOAP web service
definition](http://api.google.com/GoogleSearch.wsdl).

> **Update:** The Google SOAP web service has been deprecated and removed. See
> the blog post on the Official Google Code Blog:
> [A well earned retirement for the SOAP Search API](http://googlecode.blogspot.jp/2009/08/well-earned-retirement-for-soap-search.html)

Though after reading all of those, while returning base types like int
or string or even custom objects was easy to define, I had a hard time
figuring out how to define how to return arrays of objects (Actually,
Google's WSDL shows an example of what I'm about to describe).

I originally thought that returning a list of objects would simply
involve returning more than one of the object. Like if I defined this in
my types section:

```xml
<types>
  <xsd:complexType name='StaffList'>
    <xsd:element
      minOccurs='0'
      maxOccurs='unbounded'
      name='staffname'
      type='Staff'/>
  </xsd:complexType>
  <xsd:complexType name='Staff'>
    <xsd:all>
      <xsd:element
        minOccurs='0'
        maxOccurs='1'
        name='staffname'
        type='xsd:string'/>
      <xsd:element
        minOccurs='0'
        maxOccurs='1'
        name='staffposition'
        type='xsd:string'/>
      <xsd:element
        minOccurs='0'
        maxOccurs='1'
        name='salary'
        type='xsd:int'/>
    </xsd:all>
  </xsd:complexType>
</types>
```

For reference this is my message definition:

```xml
<message name='GetStaffRequest'>
  <part name='sessionid' type='xsd:string'/>
  <part name='staffid' type='xsd:int'/>
</message>
<message name='GetStaffResponse'>
  <part name='Result' type='StaffList'/>
</message>
```

That's a perfectly fine piece of XML Schema but unfortunately web
services clients and servers won't recognize it. Instead you need to put
a restriction on your returned type to define the array you are
returning as a <http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/:Array>. Sounds
hard but it is really just a matter of following the pattern below
instead of what I did above.

```xml
<xsd:complexType name='StaffList'>
  <xsd:complexContent mixed='false'>
    <xsd:restriction base='soapenc:Array'>
      <xsd:attribute wsdl:arrayType='Staff[]' ref='soapenc:arrayType' />
    </xsd:restriction>
  </xsd:complexContent>
</xsd:complexType>
<xsd:complexType name='Staff'>
  <xsd:all>
    <xsd:element
      minOccurs='0'
      maxOccurs='1'
      name='staffname'
      type='xsd:string'/>
    <xsd:element
      minOccurs='0'
      maxOccurs='1'
      name='staffposition'
      type='xsd:string'/>
    <xsd:element
      minOccurs='0'
      maxOccurs='1'
      name='salary'
      type='xsd:int'/>
  </xsd:all>
</xsd:complexType>
```

The message definition doesn't need to change from above. After doing
that your favorite web services client or server that supports WSDL
should recognize that what you are returning is an array type properly.
