The Kay team just just released Kay 1.1\! I want to thank Takashi Matsuo, Nickolas Daskalou, Tasuku Suenaga, and Yosuke Suzuki for their hard work on this release.

_Kay is a web framework made specifically for Google App Engine. The basic design of Kay is based on the Django framework, such as middleware, settings, pluggable applications, etc. Kay uses Werkzeug as lower level framework, Jinja2 as template engine, and babel for handling language translations._

Kay 1.1 contains a number of new features and bug fixes. You can see the [Release Notes here](http://code.google.com/p/kay-framework/wiki/ReleaseNotes#Kay-1.1.0rc2_-_March_3rd_2011) and can [download the release here](http://code.google.com/p/kay-framework/downloads/list).

We're excited about this release so I would like to introduce a few of Kay's new features.

## cron_only

Kay has a new utility decorator for securing cron views so they can only be run
by the cron system on App Engine.

```python
@cron_only
def my_cron_view(request):
    # ...
    return response
```

You can see the [documentation for the cron_only decorator here](http://kay-docs.shehas.net/decorators.html#kay.utils.decorators.cron_only).

## Pagination API

We added a new Pagination API which will allow developers to quickly and easily implement pagination in their views.

```python
from kay.utils.paginator import Paginator, InvalidPage, EmptyPage
from kay.utils import render_to_response

def listing(request):
    contact_list = Contacts.all()
    paginator = Paginator(contact_list, 25) # Show 25 contacts per page

    # Make sure page request is an int. If not, deliver first page.
    try:
        page = int(request.args.get('page', '1'))
    except ValueError:
        page = 1

    # If page request (9999) is out of range, deliver last page of results.
    try:
        contacts = paginator.page(page)
    except (EmptyPage, InvalidPage):
        contacts = paginator.page(paginator.num_pages)

    return render_to_response('list.html', {"contacts": contacts})
```

Page objects can be used in views to display information about the current page and item indexes.

```django
{% for contact in contacts.object_list %}
{# Each "contact" is a Contact model object. #}
{{ contact.full_name|upper }}<br />
...
{% endfor %}

<div class="pagination">
    <span class="step-links">
        {% if contacts.has_previous %}
            <a href="?page={{ contacts.previous_page_number }}">previous</a>
        {% endif %}

        <span class="current">
            Page {{ contacts.number }} of {{ contacts.paginator.num_pages }}.
        </span>

        {% if contacts.has_next %}
            <a href="?page={{ contacts.next_page_number }}">next</a>
        {% endif %}
    </span>
</div>
```

The Pagination API is designed to make as few Datastore RPC calls as possible. For instance, if you don't use the `num_pages` or `count` properties, the Pagination API will not make a count() RPC call.

You can view the [Pagination API documentation here](http://kay-docs.shehas.net/pagination.html).

## Live Settings

Redeploying applications can create latency spikes in your application because it requires stopping and restarting all of your application instances. Kay 1.1 adds a new `kay.ext.live_settings` application which provides an API for storing global settings that can be changed without redeploying your application.

Live Settings are stored with a unicode key to unicode value, and work much like memcached, but provide a fast, persistent, and eventually consistent way of storing and getting settings. Live Settings can be changed programmatically:

```python
from kay.ext.live_settings import live_settings

value = live_settings.get("my.settings.key", "default_value")

live_settings.set("my.settings.key", "new-value")
```

Or they can be managed via a custom Admin page:

You can read the [Live Settings documentation here](http://kay-docs.shehas.net/extensions.html#module-kay.ext.live_settings)

## AppStatsMiddleware

Kay 1.1 adds a new `AppStatsMiddleware` that allows you to easily enable [Appstats](http://code.google.com/intl/en/appengine/docs/python/tools/appstats.html). You simply add the middleware to your `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` in order to enable Appstats.

```python
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    # ...
    'kay.ext.appstats.middleware.AppStatsMiddleware',
    # ...
)
```

The `AppStatsMiddleware` can work with the Live Settings API and can be enabled and disabled without redeploying your application. You can read the [documentation for the AppStats extension here](http://kay-docs.shehas.net/extensions.html#module-kay.ext.appstats)

## EReporter

Kay 1.1 adds a new `kay.ext.ereporter` application which will catch and save
information about errors for later viewing and can send out daily error reports.
The EReporter application works much like the [EReporter in the App Engine
SDK](http://code.google.com/intl/en/appengine/articles/python/recording_exceptions_with_ereporter.html)
but provides a convenient way of viewing the errors via a custom admin page and
integrates with Kay's `ADMINS` and email related settings.

## Conclusion

Kay 1.1 adds a number of new features which we hope will make development and
management of applications on App Engine easier.

As always we would love to hear from you\! Please check out [Kay's project
page](http://code.google.com/p/kay-framework/). We encourage you to send us bug
reports and feature requests via our [issues
