While John C. Dvorak generally writes flamebait that you shouldn't pay attention
to, there is usually a nugget of truth in his writing. This time Mr. Dvorak
points out that [iPhones are not
desktops](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2278808,00.asp). He says iPhones
but he really means all mobile devices of various shapes and sizes from mobile
phones to laptops. The idea that mobiles are not desktops might seem obvious.

"Duh, a desktop is not mobile" you might think but the point is really about
building applications. Are people willing to trust putting their personal data
into a mobile device that is easily lost, stolen, dropped in a toilet or
otherwise damaged? [Recent
research](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7275407.stm) demonstrated that
we can't even trust laptops where the hard drive has been encrypted if it's
turned on or in sleep mode. I'm not sure how many criminals carry around aerosol
canisters to cool memory down or have the technical know-how to take advantage of
this flaw. That sounds like the work of more organized crime; most stolen
laptops in the news so far seem to have been stolen by regular thieves who aimed
to sell it on the black market. But how many individual people actually have an
encrypted partition on their personal laptop? I have heard of a few instances of
people doing that on the GnuCash mailing lists but I would venture to guess that
the answer is not many. And an encrypted partition on a mobile is out of the
question. Many phones have a key that they use to lock the phone but how many
people turn it off or lock it when they aren't using it?

Security isn't the only concern with mobile development either. Mobiles, almost
by definition, are conspicuous devices that allow us to stay connected even when
away from the computer. This is powerful but understanding that a mobile device
is _mobile_ is critical to properly managing the data that's on it as well as
our behavior when using the device. Depending too much on the devices for
normal work that should be done on the desktop is most likely not going to work
well. Dvorak makes a number of points about why the desktop computer is the best
platform. Essentially the desktop is better at everything compared to the laptop
except in portability. Portability is a big factor but essentially it means that
when you are at home or at work, use a desktop and when you are traveling use a
mobile (A hammer for a nail, a screwdriver for a screw etc.). Use the best tool
for the job.

> **Update:** Dvorak forgot one more advantage of mobiles, energy efficiency.

In the end it feels like the tech industry is jumping to mobile simply because
it's unexplored territory (read not monetized yet), even when the desktop hasn't
really been fully explored yet.
