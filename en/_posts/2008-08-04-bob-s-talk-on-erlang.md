I just watched this video of [Bob](http://bob.pythonmac.org/) giving a
presentation at [C4[1]](http://c4.rentzsch.com/1/) about
[erlang](http://www.erlang.org/). It's about a year old and Bob had been using
erlang for almost a year at that point. Bob always seems to have his hands in
things just before they become super popular. Erlang seems to be one of those
things. [JSON](http://www.json.org/) was another. He's even the guy that
[coined the term jsonp](http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/)
before that was really popular. Anyway, highly informative. I might give
erlang a try a little later on.
