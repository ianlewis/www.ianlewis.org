<p>Just watched this video of <a href="http://bob.pythonmac.org/">Bob</a> giving a presentation at <a href="http://c4.rentzsch.com/1/">C4[1]</a> about <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">erlang</a>. It's about a year old and Bob had been using erlang for almost a year at that point. Bob always seems to have his hands in things just before they become super popular. Erlang seems to be one of those things. <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> was another. He's even the guy that <a href="http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/">coined the term jsonp</a> before that was really popular. Anyway, highly informative. I might give erlang a try a little later on.</p>
