I'm about 2 weeks late getting around to writing about Google I/O and
most people already know what went on but I'll share a bit more. The
keynote was given by [Vic
Gundotra](http://www.google.com/search?q=Vic+Gundotra). Vic announced
that Google would be pushing
[HTML 5.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_5) in order to speed up
acceptance of the web as a platform. He included 5 things that Google is
excited about. These include,

- The canvas tag
- The video tag
- GPS/Location data
- Offline data
- Web workers

At the end he announced that everyone gets an android phone. Since
Android phones are starting to come out now they seem to really be
ramping up trying to get people to write applications.

After attending sessions, mostly on appengine, I attended the after
hours party which included interesting talks with Brett Slatkin and
[Guido Van Rossum](http://www.python.org/~guido/) both from the
appengine team and one being, of course, the creator of the python
programming language and ridiculously famous.
