HTTP/2 is a new version of HTTP with added functionality, including connection
multiplexing and header compression. There is currently no HTTP/2
implementation in the Go standard library, but there are a couple of libraries
under development that you can use to create HTTP/2 servers and clients in Go.

The canonical library is the
[golang.org/x/net/http2](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/http2) library by
Brad Fitzpatrick. This library will eventually be added to the Go standard
library, but it currently lives in a separate package while under development.
It’s still under active development so your milage may vary, but you should
probably use this library if you are implementing an HTTP/2 server.

## Create an HTTP/2 Server

Using the http2 library to write a server is fairly easy. The http2 library
integrates with the http package in the standard library. You just need to make
a call to `http2.ConfigureServer()` to configure a normal http server to use
HTTP/2. You will need to set up TLS encryption if accessing your server via a
browser or it will fall back to using HTTP 1.x. Though encryption isn’t
required, no browser clients currently support unencrypted HTTP/2.

```go
package main

import (
  "log"
  "net/http"
  "os"

  "golang.org/x/net/http2"
)

func main() {
  cwd, err := os.Getwd()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }

  srv := &http.Server{
    Addr:    ":8000", // Normally ":443"
    Handler: http.FileServer(http.Dir(cwd)),
  }
  http2.ConfigureServer(srv, &http2.Server{})
  log.Fatal(srv.ListenAndServeTLS("server.crt", "server.key"))
}
```

## Create an HTTP/2 Client

Currently the implementation in the `http2` library is pretty hacky. Although
it spits out lots of debug style logging, it works for the most part. You use
an `http2.Transport` object and pass it to a normal client from the `http`
package.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "io/ioutil"
  "log"
  "net/http"

  "golang.org/x/net/http2"
)

func main() {
  client := http.Client{
    // InsecureTLSDial is temporary and will likely be
    // replaced by a different API later.
    Transport: &http2.Transport{InsecureTLSDial: true},
  }

  resp, err := client.Get("https://localhost:8000/")
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }

  body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }

  fmt.Println(string(body))
}
```

## Further Reading

If you’re interested in learning more about HTTP/2 you can check out the
[HTTP/2 homepage](https://http2.github.io/), which has lots of links to other
material and implementations in other languages.

If you are interested in a deeper look at how HTTP/2 clients and servers are
implemented one alternative implementation worth exploring is [Jxck's http2
implementation](https://github.com/Jxck/http2). Jxck implements HTTP/2 handling
by hooking into `TLSNextProto` on a [standard HTTP
server](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Server). You can see a sample use of
it [here](https://github.com/Jxck/http2/blob/master/sample/http.go).

The grpc-go library also has its own implementation of an HTTP/2
[client](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/master/transport/http2_client.go)
and
[server](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/master/transport/http2_server.go)
in the transport package.
