On Saturday we held our first Python JP 2011. We had approximately 230
people show up which I think is great for a first time Python conference
in Japan. I want to thank all of the members of the planning committee,
staff, and attendees for such a wonderful event. I had so much fun\!

The Python community in Japan is growing but has not been very organized
so it has been hard to see how many people are using Python in Japan.
The Python community and conference is very large in the U.S. and Europe
but until this conference, I had never felt like there were many
developers in Japan. The number and enthusiasm of the attendees has
renewed my confidence that we can have a large thriving community of
Python programmers here as well.

I participated in the conference as a planner, staff member, and
speaker, but I really didn't do much. The credit goes to a few amazing
people who did a much better job than I could have ever done. This
PyconJP's conference chair was Manabu Terada
([@terapyon](http://twitter.com/terapyon)) and the vice-chair's were
Yasushi Masuda ([@whosaysni](http://twitter.com/whosaysni)) and Takayuki
Shimizukawa ([@shimizukawa](https://twitter.com/#!/shimizukawa)). Our
unofficial vice-chair was Takanori Suzuki
([@takonory](https://twitter.com/takanory)). These folks did a
tremendious job organizing the conference.

As a speaker I gave an English language talk entitled "Asynchronous
Python Programming" in which I talked about how one does asynchronous
and conncurrent programming in Python. The ustream video for my talk is
below.

> Update (2023/10/30): The video is no longer available.

Thanks again everyone for such an awesome conference!
