I recently read a blog post that is a satirical look at how to gain a
reputation as a guru programmer by converting code to your own code and
making it hard for other programmers to get their work done. It's called
[3 Simple Rules That Will Make You a ‘Superstar’
Developer](http://coderoom.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/3-simple-rules-that-will-make-you-a-superstar-developer/)
and it's very tongue in cheek.

It outlines 3 simple rules to be a superstar programmer.

**Rule 1: Write lots of code.** i.e. Rewrite large amounts of the
codebase to your own code since you will be more productive fixing bugs
and others will have a harder time.

**Rule 2: Write your code quickly.** Get things done fast. Don't worry
about introducing bugs that are hard to find, but don't introduce
trivial ones.

**Rule 3: Don’t take time to document your code.** It takes time and
others will be able to understand your code better.

This might actually work well in medium/large companies with closed
systems. This strategy would work great at my first job out of college.
If no one could touch my code but me, I would be king.

This kind of thing is exactly why open source is so great. In open
source this strategy doesn't work because the success of the project
depends on how many other developers you can get to work on it. And your
reputation depends on the cleanliness of the code base.

So I'd like to propose how to actually make yourself a 10x developer.

1. **Get out of your current job.** If you have a job anything like the
   above. Get out and get out as fast as possible. You are wasting time
   spending most of your day in an environment that will not allow you
   to grow. Get out. I can't stress this enough. Environment is VERY
   important.
2. **Read lots of code.** Preferably other people's code of good
   reputation. You need to read lots of good code to understand how to
   write good code. It's that simple. Understand why a particular
   implementation is convenient or fast and why other's are slow or not
   as convenient for the problem that is being solved.
3. **Read lots of documentation, blogs, articles and stay on top of
   emerging trends.** Understand what other developers are talking
   about and why. Your options are so much broader when you know what
   other projects to look at and what to research when presented with a
   hard problem.
4. **Write lots of code and work hard.** Everything takes practice and
   writing code is no exception. Knowing in your brain how to write
   code is not the same as doing it. I know how to hit a baseball but
   that doesn't mean I CAN ACTUALLY hit it, for real, let alone hit a
   homerun. Write a lot and preferably public code. You won't get much
   of a reputation with closed products unless you did most of the work
   on a product that is widely used and that is publicly known.
5. **Don't complain when things don't work.** If something doesn't work
   it's likely your code that's causing it. Even if you think it's not
   and complain when something's not working it's very embarrassing
   when it turns out that it was your code that was the problem that
   you have been complaining about all day. You won't make friends by
   complaining.
6. **Go to programming events and conferences.** Events with other
   programmers is very rewarding. A big problem with working hard is
   it's hard to stay motivated. Other programmers commenting on work
   you did can be very motivational and give you lots of ideas. Also,
   other programmers can be introduced to you and your work and you can
   get a feel for what other people are using to solve problems. Don't
   assume someone doesn't know what they are doing. Many times they
   surprise you with something you didn't know about.

Ok, that's 6 things. Notice that only one is writing code though you'll
need to do that a lot. On a typical day I probably spend about 40%
writing and 60% reading. Knowing a lot about other projects, ways of
writing code, algorithms, and programming methodology will help you a
lot (though not right away). Learning programming is a lot like learning
another language (which I also have some experience with), there is a
large sunk cost and it takes a lot of time to get to a level of fluency.

That's it. Let me know if you have any comments\!
