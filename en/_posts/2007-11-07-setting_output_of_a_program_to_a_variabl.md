I recently had to do this to get
[TortoiseMerge](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/TortoiseMerge.html) working with
[Mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/) within
[Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/). It turned out to be pretty easy and I
couldn't believe that a
[lot](http://www.infionline.net/~wtnewton/batch/batchfaq.html#9)
[of](http://www.student.northpark.edu/pemente/sed/bat_env.htm#sed)
[people](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/230090-45-windows-batch-file-output-program-variable)
were saying that you had to route the output to a temporary file and then read
it back into your program or some such garbage. Anyway, behold!!

```bat
for /f &quot;tokens=1&quot; %%A in (
    '"cygpath -w %1"' ) do set TMergePath1=%%A
```

It's kind of a hack using the [FOR
/f](http://www.robvanderwoude.com/ntfortokens.html) but it basically allows you
to set the output of a program to a variable. You can even parse the output to
pull out a particular piece of the output to put in the variable. This is
particularly useful with windows commandline programs which weren't really made
to be piped and redirected.

Anyway, in my case I'm setting the output of cygpath called on a cygwin path to
convert it into a windows path and then set the output to the TMergePath
variable. The `tokens=1` part tells the program that I only want to call the
code after `do` for the first token. In my case there is only one anyway. You
can set `tokens=1,2,4` if you want to loop for the first, second and forth
tokens. You can also set the delimiter like `tokens=1,2,4 delims=;` if your
output looks like token1;token2;token3;token4
