<p>Me and a number of people are starting a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tokyohackerspace.com/">new hackerspace</a> in Tokyo. From the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hackerspaces.org">http://www.hackerspaces.org</a> homepage:</p>

Hackerspaces are community-operated physical places, where people can meet and work on their projects.

<p>Me and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.miwaza.com/">miwaza</a> came up with the idea (well mostly miwaza) for starting up a hackerspace in Tokyo and miwaza took it upon herself to tell give a 2 minute talk and tell everyone that she thought we should create one. Many people thought it was a great idea and have started moving to get it created. Most hackerspaces have to do with hacking hardware but I thought that a hackerspace could pretty much be used for any kind of hacking. My personal thought was to make it kind of a place where artistic folks could come and make artwork as well. Art hacking if you will. Of course software also falls in this category. Anything having to do with &quot;making things&quot;.</p>
<p>There is already a hackerspace in Tokyo called <a class="reference external" href="http://456.im/">4ncho5la6</a> (AnchorLab) which is fairly famous but it isn't an open communal space. It's currently run by 4 guys who run their own companies, but they do have events and create all kinds of nifty stuff which they open up to the public. They event wrote a <a class="reference external" href="http://456.im/wp/2009/06/tokyohackerspace/">blog about us</a>. Here are some of 4ncho5la6's creations.</p>
