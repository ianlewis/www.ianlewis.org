Me and a number of people are starting a [new
hackerspace](http://www.tokyohackerspace.com/) in Tokyo. From the
[http://www.hackerspaces.org](http://www.hackerspaces.org) homepage:

Hackerspaces are community-operated physical places, where people can meet and
work on their projects.

Me and [miwaza](http://www.miwaza.com/) came up with the idea (well mostly
miwaza) for starting up a hackerspace in Tokyo and miwaza took it upon herself
to tell give a 2 minute talk and tell everyone that she thought we should create
one. Many people thought it was a great idea and have started moving to get it
created. Most hackerspaces have to do with hacking hardware but I thought that a
hackerspace could pretty much be used for any kind of hacking. My personal
thought was to make it kind of a place where artistic folks could come and make
artwork as well. Art hacking if you will. Of course software also falls in this
category. Anything having to do with "making things".

There is already a hackerspace in Tokyo called [4ncho5la6](http://456.im/)
(Anchorlab) which is fairly famous but it isn't an open communal space. It's
currently run by 4 guys who run their own companies, but they do have events and
create all kinds of nifty stuff which they open up to the public. They event
wrote a [blog about us](http://456.im/wp/2009/06/tokyohackerspace/). Here are
some of 4ncho5la6's creations.
