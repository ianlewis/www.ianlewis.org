There is a small but growing Python community in Japan. Many people, even some of those Python enthusiasts who living in Japan, are unaware of this and don't know who any of these people are. There are a lot of reasons for this but the number one reason is probably the large language barrier between Japanese speakers and non-Japanese speakers. Currently it can be kind of hard to know who's interested in what, or who the go-to person is for a particular topic. I think that's a shame and that there should be more communication going on with the community in Japan and the wider Python community, and a lot of the Japanese community leaders don't get the kind of credit or publicity they deserve outside of Asia. I hope to help solve that problem with this blog post by providing a kind of who's who of Japanese Python community members.

## Atsuo Ishimoto

Atsuo is the owner of the [python.jp](http://python.jp/) domain name and one of the original moderators of the python.jp mailing list. He is a long time Python user and community leader.

Atsushi Shibata is probably the most well known community leader in Japan. He wrote the wildly popular "Minna no Python" (Everyone's Python) and led in moderating the python.jp mailing list for many years.

## Ryosuke Nakai (voluntas)

Ryosuke is the organizer of Python Onsen (PySpa) and Python Developers Festa (PyFes). Both are popular Python community events. Python Onsen is an weekend-long event where fellow Python enthusiasts travel to a Japanese Ryokan and spend the weekend coding and goofing off. PyFes is a day long event where members give tutorials and talks on Python.

## Manabu Terada (terapyon)

Manabu is the chair of the PyCon JP management team, and long-time Plone community leader. Manabu has been indispensable as the PyCon JP chair in doing the nitty-gritty organizing of the conference. A job I do not envy. He also runs his own development/consulting company focusing on Plone and Python development.
