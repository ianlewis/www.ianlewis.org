My good friend [Takashi Matsuo](http://takashi-matsuo.blogspot.com/)
wrote an interesting blog about start up times of various frameworks on
appengine. Because appengine kills your server process it often needs to
load your application into memory from scratch. This can take a lot of
time if a lot of modules are loaded.
