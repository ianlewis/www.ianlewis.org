My good friend [Takashi Matsuo](http://takashi-matsuo.blogspot.com/) wrote an
interesting blog about start up times of various frameworks on App Engine.
Because App Engine kills your server process it often needs to load your
application into memory from scratch. This can take a lot of time if a lot of
modules are loaded.
