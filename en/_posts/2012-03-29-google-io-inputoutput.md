This year's [Google IO page](https://developers.google.com/events/io/)
has a nifty little game that allows you to build a machine that guides a
ball from an input chute to an output chute. I noticed right away that
the tools you can use seem to have odd shapes as if designed for a
purpose. You could also choose the primary colors that Google uses
often. I figured that they were originally designed so that you could
easily make a machine that was in the shape of the familiar Google logo
so I went about trying to figure out how. I think I got something that's
represents the Google logo pretty well. What do you think? ;-)
