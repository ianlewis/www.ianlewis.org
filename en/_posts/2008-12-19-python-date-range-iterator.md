I couldn't find something that gave me quite what I wanted so I created
a simple [Python](http://www.python.org/) generator to give me the dates
between two datetimes.

```python
def datetimeIterator(from_date, to_date):
    from datetime import timedelta
    if from_date > to_date:
        return
    else:
        while from_date <= to_date:
            yield from_date
            from_date = from_date + timedelta(days = 1)
        return
```

> it could have been.
