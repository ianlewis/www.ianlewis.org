Last weekend I went to my second Python Onsen organized by
Nakai-san([id:voluntas](https://x.com/voluntas)). I talked about Python Onsen
in [my first blog post](/en/python-onsen). Python Onsen is a 3 day event
(Fri, Sat, Sun) but as before I only participated on Saturday and Sunday. This
time I opted to work on creating a lifestream web app using
[feedparser](http://www.feedparser.org/) and
[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/). feedparser is a snappy little parser
for reading RSS and Atom feeds. The result was dlife which so far can parse a
set of feeds and show them on a user's lifestream though it's not in any way
user friendly yet (you have to update the feeds in the django shell).

I also got to know my soon to be co-worker, Okano-san (
[id:tokibito](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nullpobug/)), by talking about
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) Internals'
[`data()`](https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/) function and web/Django
development.

Here's a recap:

- Worked on a sweetcron lifestream replacement in Django (dlife)
- Onsen is pretty lonely by yourself.
- Introduced tokibito to the jQuery Internals' `data()` function
- Since I come on Satruday, I always miss introductions so I never know who is who.
- feedparser is really simple and easy to use. Though I'm not sure what I'll do about pictures and video yet.
- No one mentioned my blog or linked to it in their posts (Maybe because I never write anything? )
- In a raffle„ÄÅI got a cool Python shirt from [Accense Technologies](http://accense.com/) Masuda-san ([id:whosaysni](https://x.com/whosaysni)).
- It was lonely going home by myself from Kinomiya station.
