Google docs wouldn't let me share the presentation publicly with people outside
our company's domain and it gave me an error when I tried to download it as a
PowerPoint file or PDF so I was forced to recreate my presentation locally.
Anyway, I placed the slides to my talk at [PyCon Asia](http://pycon.sit.rp.sg/)
online please check it out on Slideshare.
