The Python Programming Language community in Japan will be having our
first Pycon JP on August 27th at the Advanced Institute of Industrial
Technology (産業技術大学院大学) in Tokyo's Shinagawa Seaside.

Pycon JP started in the aftermath of Pycon APAC 2010 in Singapore. Pycon
APAC 2011 was set to be in Singapore again but the location of the
conference in 2012 had not been set yet. [Yasushi
Masuda](https://twitter.com/whosaysni) , [Manabu
Terada](https://twitter.com/#!/terapyon) and me discussed having the
2012 conference in Japan but we were afraid that the Python community in
Japan did not have much experience running an event that required that
level of logistics. There was a question of whether we would be able to
pull together enough manpower or whether we would have to do almost
everything with a core group of only a few people.

Instead of committing to hold Pycon APAC in 2012 we decided to have a
mini event that we dubbed [Pycon mini
JP](https://sites.google.com/site/pyconminijp/). Pycon mini JP was
designed to be a modest conference of only one track where members of
the Python community could get together. Being busy myself I was the
only original member of our first meeting that didn't help much planning
the event, but dispite that, or more likely because of that, Pycon mini
JP was held in January 2011 and was a resounding success. We had a good
many submissions for talks from various fields, and it made for a very
fun event.

For Pycon JP we have decided to scale up a bit and run a larger
conference. Though it won't be nearly as big as the multi-thousand
person conference in the 'states (only a few hundred people), we plan to
have more participants this year and chose a larger venue. We also moved
from one track to [three](http://2011.pycon.jp/program) , including one
English track where I'll be speaking about [asynchronous programming in
Python](http://2011.pycon.jp/program/talks#asyncronous-python-programming).
We are also welcoming the wonderful [Tarek
Ziade](http://tarekziade.wordpress.com/2011/08/01/pycon-france-and-pycon-japan-this-summer/)
as our keynote speaker.

I've been working with the Pycon JP planning committee and am really
excited about how well things have gone. It's really amazing how far
things have come since last year at Pycon APAC and I'm amazed at how
hard everyone is working to make the conference a success. I'm really
proud of everyone.

Anyone who happens to be in Japan and would like to attend the conference can
register on the [conference
website](http://2011.pycon.jp/audience/registration). There is a small [English
Information page](http://2011.pycon.jp/english-information) about the conference
that you can check out as well.
