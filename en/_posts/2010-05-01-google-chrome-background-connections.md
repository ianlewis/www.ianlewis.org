Today I found that google chrome was making lots of background
connections to 1e100.net. I was a little worried at first but this seems
to be a google owned domain and these connections are used for their
anti-phishing/malware feature.

But even after disabling the feature I still noticed lots of connections
open to 1e100.net:

```shell
ian@macbook-ian:~$ lsof -i4 | grep chrome
chrome  5294  ian   70u  IPv4  82734      0t0  TCP macbook-ian.local:54753->nrt04s01-in-f99.1e100.net:www (ESTABLISHED)
chrome  5294  ian   81u  IPv4  82735      0t0  TCP macbook-ian.local:54754->nrt04s01-in-f99.1e100.net:www (ESTABLISHED)
chrome  5294  ian   82u  IPv4  82736      0t0  TCP macbook-ian.local:54755->nrt04s01-in-f99.1e100.net:www (ESTABLISHED)
chrome  5294  ian   89u  IPv4  83365      0t0  TCP macbook-ian.local:56139->tx-in-f100.1e100.net:www (ESTABLISHED)
chrome  5294  ian   94u  IPv4  83413      0t0  TCP macbook-ian.local:46004->tx-in-f138.1e100.net:www (ESTABLISHED)
```

Google seems to be doing a lot of user tracking via google chrome.

As for 1e100.net, it seems to be a domain used by google as a gateway to
their server infrastructure. Simply pinging www.google.com reveals that
it's aliased to a 1e100.net subdomain:

```shell
ian@macbook-ian:~$ ping www.google.com
PING www.google.com (66.249.89.104) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from nrt04s01-in-f104.1e100.net (66.249.89.104): icmp_seq=1 ttl=51 time=10.2 ms

```
