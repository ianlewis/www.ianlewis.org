I took a look at the code of a [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) page as an
example of a site that gets lots of traffic and noticed a couple of things.

1. They use [Amazon S3](http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16427261) to
   store images
2. They split the JavaScript, favicons, and CSS up across 3 or 4 subdomains
   (assets0.twitter.com, assets2.twitter.com, etc.)
3. They include [prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/) and a version of
   [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) as well as a version of
   [script.aculo.us](http://script.aculo.us/).

```html
<script
    src="http://assets3.twitter.com/javascripts/prototype.js?1213829093"
    type="text/javascript"
></script>
<script
    src="http://assets1.twitter.com/javascripts/effects.js?1213829093"
    type="text/javascript"
></script>

<script
    src="http://assets0.twitter.com/javascripts/application.js?1213829093"
    type="text/javascript"
></script>
<script
    src="http://assets0.twitter.com/javascripts/jquery-1.2.3.min.js?1213829093"
    type="text/javascript"
></script>
```

It kind of surprised me that they include a version of prototype _AND_
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) _AND_ script.aculo.us since they aren't really
light JavaScript files. Prototype comes in at 123 kilobytes,
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is 53 kilobytes, and script.aculo.us is 38
kilobytes. Seems to me that even with caching and all they could significantly
reduce download traffic by sticking to one JavaScript library. I'm sure there is
some weird reason they do it though.
