Twitter now allows you to [download an archive of your
tweets](http://blog.twitter.com/2012/12/your-twitter-archive.html). I've gone
ahead and put up my Twitter Archive on this site so it can be perused online
easily. Please take a look at my [latest
archive](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.ianlewis.org/prod/twitter_archive/latest/index.html).

I'll periodically update this archive so that is somewhat up to date. I'll need
to do it manually so I might be able to update it about once a month or so.
