I joined Google one year ago today. It's been a really busy year and I can't
believe it's over so fast. I still feel like I just joined and there's so much
that I'm still getting used to. Google has been at the same time the easiest
and the hardest, the most fun and the least fun company I've worked at so far.
I'll try to explain a bit what I mean. But first I want to take a look back at my first year.

## Travel & Speaking

It's been a whirlwind year traveling and getting used to Google's scale. Going
from a 30 person company to a ~50,000 person company was challenging but I've
learned a lot. I visited a total of 9 countries: Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea,
Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, U.S.A., Canada, and, of course, Japan.
I'm based in Tokyo and so I mostly covered countries in the
Asia-Pacific region but I was fortunate to have the opportunity to give
presentations in front of thousands of people. I'm no stranger to
giving talks but the sheer number of people is mind blowing.

Another statistic I like to throw around is the number of offices I visited.
Google has many offices around the world and I visited a total of 15 of them
this year. Many people don't even visit that many during their entire time
working for Google.

### Google I/O

I was really fortunate to have the opportunity to give a small breakout session
at Google I/O 2015 on [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/). It was my first
time giving a talk at a such a large conference. It was a really great
experience to give a talk at such an amazing venue with so many talented
developers.

I was really nervous giving a talk in a place like Google I/O but it was a
really great experience and I hope I have a chance to do it again someday.

### Google Next

I also gave a talk on Firebase at Google Next Tokyo in front of hundreds of
developers. Google Next is a Google Cloud Platform related event that Google
held in several countries after Google I/O.

It was great to take part in such important events that can inspire developers.
At Google Next I also helped a little with the [Cloud Spin
demo](http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.jp/2015/09/Cloud-Spin-Part-1-180-degree-animations-on-Google-Cloud-Platform.html).
It was a real challenge to get it running. We required a number of components
in Tokyo for the demo to work but we were missing a few key components.

Cloud Spin is a demo where about 20 smartphones take a video of you, and pull out
a frame from each phone. These frames are then stitched together into a video that
looks like Matrix bullet time. Here's a great example created by my teammates :)

<div style="text-align:center;margin:1em">
  <video name="media" class="animated-gif" loop="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video/CYfITpjUsAAra9B.mp4" autoplay style="padding:10px;border:1px solid #CCC;box-shadow: 4px 4px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.075)">
  <source type="video/mp4" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video/CYfITpjUsAAra9B.mp4">
  </video>
</div>

The demo requires that a sound be sent from an tablet control app into each
phone at the same time. One of the components that allows this was missing so
on the day of the event we had to find some audio adapters and solder some
resistors into them in order to make the components that we needed. It all came
together at the last minute and the demo was a success. It was really great to
work together with a team that accepted the challenge to make the demo work in
such a short time frame. It was really inspiring. Here is a couple of my teammates
soldering up adapters on the morning of the event.

And here's one of the finished products :) Totally geeky right?

Getting the demo working after being in such dire straits gave me and my
teammates a real sense of accomplishment. Next time I hope we'll be able to
avoid the problem in the first place :)

### Others

I also gave talks at lots of industry conferences in APAC. I spoke at Tech
Planet in Seoul, Gave a keynote at iTHome DevOps in Taipei.

I traveled the most to Seoul and Taipei, about 3 times each. But I also had the
pleasure to travel to Malaysia, and Indonesia for the first time. It was a
really experience to meet local developers and eat great food :)

## Challenges

So this brings me back to my other thought: that Google is the easiest and the
hardest, the most fun and the least fun company I've worked for. This seems
like a contradiction. But it really that it's the easiest place to work in some
ways in the hardest to work at in others.

### People

The people at Google are great. They are really, really smart thoughtful people
that are great to work with. No place is perfect, and there are still frictions
here and there but, by in large, the interactions I have at Google are
overwhelmingly positive. The benifit of working with smart, thoughtful people
cannot be overstated. In this way it's one of the nicest places to work.

### Systems & Policies

I got the feeling, during my first year, that systems and policies at Google
are well thought out and make it easier to be productive. Things like the
performance reviews at Google are well defined and not arbitrary. That makes it
easier to know what you need to do to be promoted and doesn't get people
promoted or not promoted arbitrarily.

Google's internal systems and tools are also very good. Training tools and
collaboration are really easy.

### Challenge & Impostor Syndrome & The Fear of Missing Out

The people, systems, and policies are great but the downside to having great
people working with you is that you don't feel like you're very smart or
special. This is especially true if you previously worked in a place where you
were important and respected. Your colleagues are very smart and are always doing
great things so it's easy for you to compare yourself to them and be found wanting.

This can manifest itself in many ways. one is [Impostor
Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) where you don't
recognize your accomplishments feel like you aren't skilled enough to be
working at Google. Some people feel like their lack of skill would be found out
and they may get fired. I can't say that I've really felt like I have Impostor
Syndrome (I can't be not internalizing my accomplishments if I haven't
accomplished anything can I? ^^) but I have felt as though I was inferior
compared to my co-workers.

Another manifestation is the [fear of missing
out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out). This happens often
because my co-workers are always traveling and always doing great things. I
often compare the work I'm doing to theirs and feel like I'm missing out on
opportunities to do more or better things. It's very similar to the feeling you
get when your friends are writing about how their going skiing or camping or to
the beach and you're stuck at home.

This part of Google is what makes it one of the hardest places to work. It's an
amazing place where people are doing great work all the time. But it is really hard
to balance your life and maintain psycological well being.

## 2016

2016 is going to be really great. Google Cloud Platform is growing very quickly
and it's awesome to be a part of that. I'm working hard planning my time this
year in order to grow as much as possible. Last year I did a lot of work but I
feel like the impact was light for each trip so I spread myself a little too
thin. This year, I want to focus on the quality of my talks and interactions
with developers and create OSS projects, demos, and talks that help inspire and
inform developers better than last year.

I'm really excited for this year and I hope you are too.
