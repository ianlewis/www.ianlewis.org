I'm the kind of guy that likes to be open about data and such I thought
it might be interesting to share what kind of access pattern my humble
little bi-lingual blog gets. I really don't get that many visits, so
it's not really useful to do any kind of deep analysis so, in terms of
demographics, there are only a few metrics that are really useful to
look at. Because this is a blog and because it's bilingual the things I
look at are what content people are looking at (particularly the
language of the content), what the user's language is, and where they
are accessing from and that's basically it:

- Content
- Language
- Location

# Content

First, let's talk about content. The content on my website is accessed
about half and half. Really it's about 44% English and 43% Japanese. The
rest is a long tail of other URLs. But you can see that the content is
accessed roughly equally.

I was really surprised how very close to equal the English and Japanese
content accesses were. This also surprised me since I tend to update my
Japanese content a lot more than my English content. I suppose this is a
testament to the English speaking internet. My blog is ranked much
higher in Japanese. All things being equal I should have a lot more
accesses in Japanese but the English and Japanese accessed an equal
amount.

Anyway, the really interesting part comes when we talk about language
and content. Are Japanese speakers accessing the Japanese content? How
about the English speakers? How are the users divided? These are
questions I asked myself when looking at this kind of access data.

# Language

Actually it's not that interesting. As it turns out the languages are
also split roughly 45% Japanese/40% English with the Japanese speakers
reading the Japanese content and the English speakers reading the
English content. Users in the long tail of languages, Russian, French,
German etc. by and large read the English content. Those users make up
the difference between the English and Japanese users in terms of
access.

# Location

I noticed another thing that was interesting when I looked at location
data. Almost exactly 50% of the accesses come from inside Japan and only
about 13% from the U.S. The rest is a huge long tail of countries from
India, to Spain, to Kenya, to Latvia almost exclusively looking at
English content.

# Conclusion

I took a lot of this information into consideration when I redesigned my
website. I focused more on blog content and displayed each language
equally on the top page.

My life is in Japan, so the Japanese content is more pertinent to me and
my career, but it's clear, after looking at the data, that with half of
the accesses being to English content, I should spend a bit more time on
the English side of things.
