Python supports a simple type of multiple inheritance which allows the
creation of Mixins. Mixins are a sort of class that is used to "mix in"
extra properties and methods into a class. This allows you to create
classes in a compositional style.

Mixins are a really great concept but I often find that people use them
incorrectly which can lead to some bugs. I often see Mixins used like
the following:

```python
class Mixin1(object):
    def test(self):
        print "Mixin1"

class Mixin2(object):
    def test(self):
        print "Mixin2"

class MyClass(BaseClass, Mixin1, Mixin2):
    pass
```

However, in Python the class hierarchy is defined right to left, so in
this case the `Mixin2` class is the base class, extended by `Mixin1` and
finally by `BaseClass`. This is usually fine because many times the
mixin classes don't override each other's, or the base class' methods.
But if you do override methods or properties in your mixins this can
lead to unexpected results because the priority of how methods are
resolved is from left to right.

```python
>>> obj = MyClass()
>>> obj.test()
Mixin1
```

The correct way to use mixins is like in the reverse order:

```python
class MyClass(Mixin2, Mixin1, BaseClass):
    pass
```

This kind of looks counter-intuitive at first because most people would
read a top-down class hierarchy from left to right but if you include
the class you are defining, you can read correctly up the class
hierarchy (MyClass =\> Mixin2 =\> Mixin1 =\> BaseClass. If you define
your classes this way you won't have to many conflicts and run into too
many bugs.

```python
>>> obj = MyClass()
>>> obj.test()
Mixin2
```
