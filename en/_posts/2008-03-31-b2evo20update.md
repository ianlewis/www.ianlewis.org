<p>Today I finally updated my website and gave it a new look. I hope everyone likes it. The theme is a customized version of <a href="http://www.blog.hemminga.net/">Foppe Hemminga</a>'s simple zen theme. I thought it would work well since I wanted a theme that where the header would expand no matter what resolution you view it at and wasn't a fixed pixel size. The fact that's it's a zen theme and I live in Japan just makes it all the better. There are still some rough edges to work out but they should be fixed within the week.</p>

<p>With this upgrade I finally updated to the latest version of <a href="http://www.b2evolution.net/" title="b2evolution">b2evolution</a>. I had been using an old version for far longer than was safe but I had a number of customizations made that made upgrading difficult. I made the somewhat silly decision a while back to implement my English and Japanese blogs as one blog and customize b2evo to display the posts that matched the user's language settings on the site and via the browser. I wanted a more uniform way of updating the site but this had the unfortunate effect of making it so that I couldn't upgrade without splitting my blogs up with a database script. In the end it works much better maintaining them as two blogs.</p>
