Yesterday I attended the second [Tokyo
Hackerspace](http://www.tokyohackerspace.com/) meeting. It was the first
time I attended such the meetings which are being held weekly now. I
have a feeling that more was talked about and decided last week but it
was good to get an update on how things were going and what people were
interested in with the hackerspace. I was told that more artists and
creative folks attended the first meeting but this meeting seemed to
have mostly web and hardware folks who were interested in joining the
two worlds.

Another development was that [Chris Wang](http://www.freaklabs.org/) (in
red below) is working on a prototyping board made exclusively for the
hackerspace. He wrote about the meeting on [his
blog](http://freaklabs.org/index.php/Blog/Misc/Tokyo-Hackerspace-Meeting-2.html).
He also wrote [about the boards
themselves](http://freaklabs.org/index.php/Blog/Misc/Dev-Boards-for-Tokyo-Hackerspace.html).
