Yesterday I became the new [Google Appengine API
Expert](http://sites.google.com/site/devreljp/Home/api-expert) (Python)
for the Japan region. Google Experts are the equivalent for Google API
Gurus as they are called in the 'States. I will be helping out other
developers in Japan to learn about and use Appengine and successfully
deploy projects.

I've been playing with [Appengine](http://appengine.google.com/) since
just after it came out in 2008 and I've built a number of sites from [my
company's homepage](http://www.beproud.jp/), to applications for
internal use, to a [site for sharing code
snippets](http://www.smipple.net/). I'm currently helping to test out
new features, and provide information and support to Japanese
developers. I hope that anyone interested in Japan and interested in
Appengine will read my blog to learn more about some of the exciting
things that are happening here with Appengine.

I hang out on the English Language
[Python](http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine-python),
[Java](http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine-java) and
[Appengine General](http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine)
mailing lists, as well as the [Japanese mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/google-app-engine-japan).

I hope to let people in the 'States and elsewhere know about what's
going on in Japan and introduce them to Japan and it's developers. Hope
to talk to you soon\!
