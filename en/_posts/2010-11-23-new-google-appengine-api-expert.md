Yesterday I became the new [Google App Engine API
Expert](http://sites.google.com/site/devreljp/Home/api-expert) (Python)
for the Japan region. Google Experts are the equivalent for Google API
Gurus as they are called in the 'States. I will be helping out other
developers in Japan to learn about and use App Engine and successfully
deploy projects.

I've been playing with [App Engine](http://appengine.google.com/) since
just after it came out in 2008 and I've built a number of sites from [my
company's homepage](http://www.beproud.jp/), to applications for
internal use, to a [site for sharing code
snippets](http://www.smipple.net/). I'm currently helping to test out
new features, and provide information and support to Japanese
developers. I hope that anyone interested in Japan and interested in
App Engine will read my blog to learn more about some of the exciting
things that are happening here with App Engine.

I hang out on the English Language
[Python](http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine-python),
[Java](http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine-java) and
[App Engine General](http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine)
mailing lists, as well as the [Japanese mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/google-app-engine-japan).

I hope to let people in the 'States and elsewhere know about what's
going on in Japan and introduce them to Japan and it's developers. Hope
to talk to you soon\!
