Today I've been playing around with writing programs in
[GTK2.0](http://www.gtk.org/). This has been on my TODO list for a really long
time, almost since college, but I've never got around to it. I've revived my old
project [gorbital](http://gorbital.sourceforge.net/) and decided to rewrite it
using GTK2.0. I originally wrote it in C++ using [gtkmm](http://www.gtkmm.org/)
for GTK1.0. But GTK1.0 is long since dead. Even my beloved
[GnuCash](http://www.gnucash.org/) has finally made it to the world of GTK2.0
making it the last application I use that has made the switch
([Gaim](http://www.pidgin.im/) being the first).

The [documentation](http://www.gtk.org/api/) and the
[tutorial](http://www.gtk.org/tutorial/) are pretty complete and
strait forward.

I've also taken the opportunity to get more accustomed with
[Mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/) and I followed the instructions
on [how to set up Mercurial on
SourceForge](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MercurialOnSourceforge)
and got that working pretty well. The source code is available on
[SourceForge](http://gorbital.sourceforge.net/hg/).
