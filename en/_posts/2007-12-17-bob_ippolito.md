I found out today that the principle author of a popular
Javascript/[AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX) library
[Mochikit](http://www.mochikit.com/) is my former highschool classmate
[Bob Ippolito](http://bob.pythonmac.org/). I remember him being pretty smart. I
supposed he would make a name for himself in some CS circles and it looks like
he has. He is also apparently a co-founder of
[Mochi Media](http://mochimedia.com/), a company that makes products for content
creators. [Mochibot](http://www.mochibot.com/) can be used to track usage of
[Adobe Flash](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/) content. It looks like they
are moving into some advertising space by creating an advertising system for
casual online games.

Interesting that Bob has moved into this area. Mochikit looks like it's had
some extensive work done on it in the past few years so it looks like it's
matured well but I imagined a bit more technical, low level path like kernel or
low level API development for Bob rather than the relatively high level
application/library development in javascript/web applications. I guess
everyone follows the buck in the end to some extent and the money is in web
dev.
