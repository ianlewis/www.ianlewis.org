I wanted to have a simple incremental backup system I could use on my machine
to backup to an external drive so I came across
[this post](http://benno.id.au/blog/2007/05/30/rsync-backup) on
[Benno's blog](http://benno.id.au/blog/). Basically it involves using rsync
with the `--link-dest` option to compare files you are backing up against an previous
backup and only create new copies when the files have been modified since the
previous backup. The rsync command would look something like the following:

```shell
rsync -a --link-dest=backup.0/ /dir.to.backup/ backups.1/.
```

If the files have not been modified then it creates a hard link to the files so
it doesn't have to create a copy in order for the backup folder to have
references to all the files in the backup. Without something like that,
restoring is hard because in order to get all the files during a restore
because the latest backup would only contain files that have been updated.

The problem is that if you have an external drive that you want to be able to
use with windows you need to use the vfat file system which doesn't support
hard or soft links. I have looked around for ideas about how do get around this
problem and it might just be that I need to split the drive into two
partitions, vfat and ext2/3, and and use the ext part for backups. There at
least seems to be some [ext2/3 support for windows](http://www.fs-driver.org/)
which seems promising but using it would mean that not every windows machine
would be able to read it, just the ones with support installed. Also, the
software does not support permissions or soft links in any way so using it
might be difficult in some situations.

Both ways have downsides but I
don't use windows much at all so I'm leaning towards just making a ext3
partition. Maybe I'll do that this weekend.
