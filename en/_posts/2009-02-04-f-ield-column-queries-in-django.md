One of the neat things making it's way into Django 1.1 is [F object
queries](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/queries/#filters-can-reference-fields-on-the-model).
The F object is kind of like the Q object as it can be used it queries but it
represents a database field on the right hand side of an equality/inequality.

For the example I'll use the example models from the "[Making Queries](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/queries/)" section of the Django Documentation.

```python
class Blog(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    tagline = models.TextField()

    def __unicode__(self):
        return self.name

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    email = models.EmailField()

    def __unicode__(self):
        return self.name

class Entry(models.Model):
    blog = models.ForeignKey(Blog)
    headline = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    body_text = models.TextField()
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField()
    authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author)
    n_comments = models.IntegerField()
    n_pingbacks = models.IntegerField()
    rating = models.IntegerField()

    def __unicode__(self):
        return self.headline
```

Here we can do cool stuff like query for blog entries where the number of comments equals the number of pingbacks.

```python
>>> from django.db.models import F
>>> Entry.objects.filter(n_pingbacks__lt=F('n_comments'))
```

You can perform operations on colums or add columns together.

```python
>>> Entry.objects.filter(n_pingbacks__lt=F('n_comments') * 2)
>>> Entry.objects.filter(rating__lt=F('n_comments') + F('n_pingbacks'))
```

You can even span relationships across tables.

```python
>>> Entry.objects.filter(author__name=F('blog__name'))
```

This query ended up like this. ftester is the name of the application I made to test this.

```sql
SELECT `ftester_entry`.`id`, `ftester_entry`.`blog_id`, `ftester_entry`.`headline`, `ftester_entry`.`body_text`, `ftester_entry`.`pub_date`, `ftester_entry`.`n_comments`, `ftester_entry`.`n_pingbacks`, `ftester_entry`.`rating` FROM `ftester_entry` INNER JOIN `ftester_blog` ON (`ftester_entry`.`blog_id` = `ftester_blog`.`id`) INNER JOIN `ftester_entry_authors` ON (`ftester_entry`.`id` = `ftester_entry_authors`.`entry_id`) INNER JOIN `ftester_author` ON (`ftester_entry_authors`.`author_id` = `ftester_author`.`id`) WHERE `ftester_author`.`name` =  `ftester_blog`.`name` LIMIT 21
```

But the reason the F() object was created was to allow using the value of one
column in another column during an update. This allows you do do things like
add 1 to the pingbacks for every entry in one go without selecting the whole
batch and updating the field.

```python
Entry.objects.all().update(n_pingbacks=F('n_pingbacks') + 1)
```
