<p>Just found out about <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/">Ohloh</a>, which is an open-source community website that allows users to give each other "kudos", and the number of kudos that you give and recieve affects your standing within the open source community.</p>
<p>What I found most interesting though is that Ohloh will aggregate information about projects gleaned from the source control commits, source code, and community status of the developers. It also seems to find licensing markers in source code and display how much of the source is provided in a particular license as well as giving warnings about potential conflicts. It's really interesting since it gives some info you might not have have known about some very high profile open source projects.</p>
<p>For instance  <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/alsa">Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)</a>'s profile look like this:</p>
<p><img title="Alsa's Ohloh profile" src="http://static.ianlewis.org/prod/img/gallery/alsa.png" alt="alsa" /></p>
<p>So it gives you what kind of looks like a risk assesment for the project. Alsa look pretty good. <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/screen">Screen</a> on the other hand,</p>
