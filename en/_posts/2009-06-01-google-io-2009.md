<p>This year I attended <a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/">Google IO</a> and had so much fun that I think I'll have to break it up into several blog posts. <a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/">Google IO</a> is held in San Francisco and is the #1 <a href="http://www.google.com/" title="Google">Google</a> event of the year. About 4000 or so developers attended the event which was held in the <a href="http://maps.google.co.jp/maps?q=Moscone+West+Convention+Center+San+Francisco">Moscone West Convention Center</a>. In this post I'll kind of give the history of the events leading up to the event and some context.</p>

<p>One day in late January or so, <a href="http://www.google.com/" title="Google">Google</a> announced that registration for this year's <a href="http://www.google.com/" title="Google">Google</a> IO was open and there was a subsequent conversation on twitter that ensued which led to <a href="http://takashi-matsuo.blogspot.com/" title="松尾 貴史">id:tmatsuo</a>, <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/a2c/" title="a2c">id:a2c</a>, <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Voluntas/" title="仲居良介">id:voluntas</a>, myself, and several others proclaiming they were going to attend this year's event.</p>

<p>I found out that the office of one of my old classmates, <a href="http://bob.pythonmac.org/">Bob Ippolito</a>, is close to the event so I sort of <a href="http://twitter.com/IanMLewis/status/1154992029">jokingly invited</a> myself and <a href="http://takashi-matsuo.blogspot.com/" title="松尾 貴史">id:tmatsuo</a> to stay at his office. You might know <a href="http://twitter.com/etrepum">Bob</a> as the co-founder and CTO of a company called <a href="http://www.mochimedia.com/">MochiMedia</a>, or as the author of numerous pieces of well used free software such as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simplejson/">simplejson</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mochiweb/">MochiWeb</a>, <a href="http://www.mochikit.com">MochiKit</a>, or <a href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">PyObjC</a> or as the coiner of the phrase <a href="http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/">JSONP</a> (Note the date of the blog post). He has consistently gotten into things before they become big, including technologies such as <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=json">json</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=erlang">erlang</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=key+value+database">Non-RDBM databases</a> and often gives talks about them which essentially give you key insights into the future of web programming.</p>

<p>ded by offering to let me and <a href="http://takashi-matsuo.blogspot.com/" title="松尾 貴史">id:tmatsuo</a> stay at his apartment. However, when it came close to the event Bob realized that he was going to be at <a href="http://flashontap.com/">another conference</a> for Flash developers in Boston, which meant that we would only have one day where we were both in San Francisco. Bummer! But he let us stay at his house even though he wasn't going to be there saving us a lot of money. He was very gracious.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a few folks such as <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Voluntas/" title="仲居良介">id:voluntas</a> couldn't go to the event because of overreactions by their employers to the outbreak of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=swine+flu">swine flu</a> but almost everyone that did go arrived in San Francisco on May 26th. I'll continue in a later blog post!!</p>
