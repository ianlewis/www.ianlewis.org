I recently came across one feature of Django that seemed pretty useful for one off projects and customizations and was startled because it's one of Django's least mentioned features. In fact, I've been using Django at work for over 5 years now and didn't hear of it until this last week.

This feature is the `manage.py` command `inspectdb` which inspects the tables in an existing database and creates Python code defining the Django models for those tables. We had a use case at work where we had a database table that was not managed as a Django model, but we wanted to create tests interacting with that table. The solution was to use `inspectdb` to create a `models.py` file in a test application and add that application to `INSTALLED_APPS` when running tests. That way the table is created via syncdb when the tests are run, and we can use the model to create/check test data.

One of my other co-workers mentioned that `inspectdb` could be used to create Django models for an entirely different system not written in Python, say [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), and very easily create Django admin for that system. So I decided to try just that. I would create a WordPress database, use `inspectdb` on that database, and create a very simple alternative admin for WordPress.

Let's get started.

## Initializing the Project

> I'm going to assume you have WordPress installed and the database set up so I won't provide any instructions on how to install WordPress here. You can check out how to install the latest WordPress on WordPress' homepage: [Installing WordPress](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress)
>
> Also, I've created a repository on github so that you can try out this code without having to copy and paste everything. It's located here: <https://github.com/IanLewis/wordpress_django_admin>

First we are going to create a Django project for our WordPress admin. Django 1.5 will be released soon but this project is going to use 1.4, which is the latest stable version as of this writing.

First we'll install Django (As we should be doing with all Python projects, you'll want to be using virtualenv):

```shell
pip install Django
```

We'll also need to install the appropriate database driver library. For MySQL it's mysql-python:

```shell
pip install mysql-python
```

After that we'll start a project using `django-admin.py`:

```shell
django-admin.py startproject wordpress_admin
```

Next, let's edit the `settings.py`. We'll need to add settings for how to connect to the database. You'll need to set this correctly so that Django can connect to your wordpress database. We will be putting the Django tables that we need in a separate database so you'll need to create that database separately.

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'wordpress_admin',
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'HOST': '',
        'PORT': '',
    },
    'wordpress': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'wordpress',
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'HOST': '',
        'PORT': '',
    },
}
```

Set up your `INSTALLED_APPS` to include the Django admin and our `wordpress` app that we'll create in a few moments:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.sites',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    # Django Admin
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.admindocs',

    # Our wordpress app
    'wordpress',
)
```

Next is `urls.py`. We only need the Django admin here:

```python
from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url

# Django Admin
from django.contrib import admin
admin.autodiscover()

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    # Django Admin
    url(r'^admin/doc/', include('django.contrib.admindocs.urls')),
    url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
)
```

## Create the wordpress application

Next we'll create a `wordpress` application to hold our Django models. Let's do that now:

```shell
python manage.py startapp wordpress
```

Now, here's the fun part. We're going to use the real WordPress database to create our Django models.

```shell
python manage.py inspectdb --database=wordpress > wordpress/models.py
```

You can now inspect the `wordpress/models.py` and take a look at the generated models. It will look something like the following:

```python
# This is an auto-generated Django model module.
# You'll have to do the following manually to clean this up:
#     * Rearrange models' order
#     * Make sure each model has one field with primary_key=True
# Feel free to rename the models, but don't rename db_table values or field names.
#
# Also note: You'll have to insert the output of 'django-admin.py sqlcustom [appname]'
# into your database.

from django.db import models

class WpCommentmeta(models.Model):
    meta_id = models.BigIntegerField(primary_key=True)
    comment_id = models.BigIntegerField()
    meta_key = models.CharField(max_length=765, blank=True)
    meta_value = models.TextField(blank=True)
    class Meta:
        db_table = u'wp_commentmeta'

class WpComments(models.Model):
    comment_id = models.BigIntegerField(primary_key=True, db_column='comment_ID') # Field name made lowercase.
    comment_post_id = models.BigIntegerField(db_column='comment_post_ID') # Field name made lowercase.
    comment_author = models.TextField()
    comment_author_email = models.CharField(max_length=300)
    comment_author_url = models.CharField(max_length=600)
    comment_author_ip = models.CharField(max_length=300, db_column='comment_author_IP') # Field name made lowercase.
    comment_date = models.DateTimeField()
    comment_date_gmt = models.DateTimeField()
    comment_content = models.TextField()
    comment_karma = models.IntegerField()
    comment_approved = models.CharField(max_length=60)
    comment_agent = models.CharField(max_length=765)
    comment_type = models.CharField(max_length=60)
    comment_parent = models.BigIntegerField()
    user_id = models.BigIntegerField()
    class Meta:
        db_table = u'wp_comments'

# <snip>
```

Next, we need to register the models with Django's admin. This is a bit of a pain as it requires some hand coding. Save this in `wordpress/admin.py`:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from wordpress.models import (
    WpCommentmeta,
    WpComments,
    WpLinks,
    WpOptions,
    WpPostmeta,
    WpPosts,
    WpTermRelationships,
    WpTermTaxonomy,
    WpTerms,
    WpUsermeta,
    WpUsers,
)

admin.site.register(WpCommentmeta)
admin.site.register(WpComments)
admin.site.register(WpLinks)
admin.site.register(WpOptions)
admin.site.register(WpPostmeta)
admin.site.register(WpPosts)
admin.site.register(WpTermRelationships)
admin.site.register(WpTermTaxonomy)
admin.site.register(WpTerms)
admin.site.register(WpUsermeta)
admin.site.register(WpUsers)
```

## Database Routing

We're going to be using multiple databases so let's create a database router to tell Django which tables live it which database. We'll be lifting this code strait from an example from the Django docs (See: [Multiple databases](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/db/multi-db/#an-example))

Let's put this in `wordpress_admin/router.py`:

```python
class WordPressRouter(object):
    """A router to control all database operations on models in
    the wordpress application"""

    def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
        "Point all operations on wordpress models to 'wordpress'"
        if model._meta.app_label == 'wordpress':
            return 'wordpress'
        return None

    def db_for_write(self, model, **hints):
        "Point all operations on wordpress models to 'wordpress'"
        if model._meta.app_label == 'wordpress':
            return 'wordpress'
        return None

    def allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):
        "Allow any relation if a model in wordpress is involved"
        if obj1._meta.app_label == 'wordpress' or obj2._meta.app_label == 'wordpress':
            return True
        return None

    def allow_syncdb(self, db, model):
        "We don't create the wordpress tables via Django."
        return model._meta.app_label != 'wordpress'
```

Next we'll add the following to our `settings.py`:

```python
DATABASE_ROUTERS = ('wordpress_admin.router.WordPressRouter',)
```

## Create the Django Database

We'll need to create a database on the Django side of things so we'll do something like this:

```shell
echo "CREATE DATABASE wordpress_admin CHARACTER SET utf8;" | mysql -u root
```

Replace the appropriate mysql options with those for your database.

Next we'll run `syncdb`:

```shell
$ python manage.py syncdb
Error: One or more models did not validate:
wordpress.wpposts: "id": You can't use "id" as a field name, because each model automatically gets an "id" field if none of the fields have primary_key=True. You need to either remove/rename your "id" field or add primary_key=True to a field.
wordpress.wpterms: "slug": CharField cannot have a "max_length" greater than 255 when using "unique=True".
```

You'll notice that a couple models didn't validate. So we'll need to update them. The first `WpPosts` needs it's `id` field updated. Since it's the primary key we can just add the `primary_key` keyword to it:

```python
class WpPosts(models.Model):
    id = models.BigIntegerField(db_column='ID', primary_key=True) # Field name made lowercase.
    # <snip>
```

The `WpTerms` model's `slug` field can't have a `unique=True` index with a field larger than 255 in Django. Since we aren't really doing that much with the field we can simply remove the `unique` keyword.

```python
class WpTerms(models.Model):
    term_id = models.BigIntegerField(primary_key=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=600)
    slug = models.CharField(max_length=600)
    # <snip>
```

Now we'll run `syncdb` again and this time it should create our Django tables for us:

```shell
python manage.py syncdb
```

## Start the Server

Now we can start the server and view our admin at <http://localhost:8000/admin/>:

```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

You'll need to login to view the admin. One thing to note is that for the Django admin we authenticate with the Django user we created when running syncdb for the first time and not WordPress' users.

## Conclusion

I hope you realized some of the interesting things you can do with the `inspectdb` command. We didn't really have to use WordPress. We could just as easily have used any database application, like [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) or [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/). There's also an endless amount of customization you could do using the Django admin to provide a richer experience. You can get started by reading the Django docs for the admin: [The Django admin site](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/contrib/admin/). Have fun\!
