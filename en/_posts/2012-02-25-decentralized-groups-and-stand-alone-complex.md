The other day I watched the talk "The coming war on general computation"
by [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/) editor [Cory
Doctorow](http://boingboing.net/about#cory).

The talk itself was very interesting and I encourage anyone interested
in the recent attempts to pass laws like SOPA to listen to the talk.
Cory makes a lot of sense in his arguments and his delivery is very
interesting and easy to digest.

That said, what caught my attention was a comment he made after the talk
when answering questions. He mentioned how he would talk about the
hacker/activist "group" Anonymous and that people would constantly
correct him about what Anonymous was.

He went on to say that Anonymous and Occupy groups (like Occupy Wall
Street) are formed and don't have a hierarchical structure. With
networks we can coordinate easily so hierarchical structures are not
necessary. The organization and communication comes for free. Because
historically these groups couldn't exist without a hierarchy because it
was needed for effective communication, we lack a vocabulary for this
kind of group or organization.

Groups before networks couldn't get together and organize without a set
of common goals, but now they can get together and organize events
without a set of common goals, and decide on them later because
organizing is easy.

# Stand Alone Complex?

The loose knit organization and loose goals, reminded me of terrorist
groups, open-source hackers, and a Stand Alone Complex (Ghost in the
Shell: Stand Alone Complex). Open source hackers are probably different
however as there is usually a project that people gather around.
Anonymous and Occupy probably most similar to the structure of terrorist
organizations which had this kind of organization style mostly because
of their many divergent radical views. Anyway, most people are familiar
with terrorist groups, and open-source hackers as they have been covered
extensively at least for the last 10 years or so.

What interested me was a possible connection between these new style
groups and a Stand Alone Complex. In a Stand Alone Complex, disconnected
people attempt to copy, and emulate an originator of an event or idea,
when the event or originator did not exist or wasn't perceived to have
the same meaning. This has the effect of seeming like a connected
movement, or group when there was no real group, or originator. In the
end the group of disconnected copycats can actually have a net effect of
purpose or cause change in social structure.

The idea may be slightly different from Anonymous or Occupy movements
but the disorganized, and decentralized nature of the groups makes for
an interesting parallel.
