These are some of the things I was reading this last week or so.

## Code

- [sbp](https://github.com/brujoand/sbp)

    A nice little bash prompt library. I decided to use this in my
    [dotfiles](https://github.com/ianlewis/dotfiles) and wrote a [Tokyo
    Night](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) theme for it.

- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)

    A linter for CSS that can be extended to cover SASS. I added this to my
    [website](https://github.com/ianlewis/www.ianlewis.org) to improve its
    stylesheets.

## Tech

- [Things You Never Wanted To Know About Go Interfaces - mcyoung](https://mcyoung.xyz/2024/12/12/go-abi/)

    This a somewhat hard to follow, but very useful post about the
    implementation of types, interfaces, and functions in Go. It's useful to
    understand how languages implement certain features so you can reason about
    what is and isn't efficient code in that language.

- [Waterfall in 15 Minutes or Your Money Back - Harper
  Reed](https://harper.blog/2025/04/10/waterfall-in-15-minutes-or-your-money-back/)

    Harper Reed writes about AI and it's impact on the craft of programming. He
    seems to come down on the side of viewing the future of programming as
    juggling different tasks around the edges of an AI doing the core programming
    work. He mentions that the "flow state" might be overrated and that
    constantly context-switching between tasks will be more prevalent.

    I tend to think that many tasks will be automated away, but that the most
    valuable engineers will be the ones that know deeply about how the system is
    actually working. Abstractions like an OS or API allow us to have a shallow
    understanding of their inner workings because they generally have a
    consistent, documented behavior that AI doesn't really have by design.

- [I'm Leaving Sentry - Armin
  Ronacher](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/3/31/leaving/)

    Armin was and is a big name in the Python community who has also become a well
    known member of the Rust community. I used Sentry before it was a product and
    I fondly remember hosting Armin as [keynote speaker for PyCon JP
    2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDlFk1hc8kc&list=PLMkWB0UjwFGnG0fLNi1kyNqFI19s3kCeH).
    Dave Cramer was there as well and we had many great conversations during the
    conference. While it was a few months after Armin's [first commit to
    Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/7b82413ce9a011ffca14aa8e98721211aabad77e)
    that he mentions in his post, I'd like to think I contributed to his success
    at Sentry in my own small way. Good luck to him in the future!

## Personal growth

- [What High Performers Know About Doing Hard
  Things - The Caring Techie Newsletter](https://www.thecaringtechie.com/p/what-high-performers-know-about-doing)

    The thesis is that doing hard things is the most impactful and that we should
    train ourselves to do hard things. I wouldn't describe much of the impactful
    things that I worked on as "hard" though. Looking back they were some of the
    most fun work I did and it I was easily motivated to do it.

    The things I thought were hard were often unrewarding and were hard _because_
    they were unimpactful.

## Politics / Economics

- [What Felt Impossible Became Possible - Dan Sinker](https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-02-23-dale/)

    Dan Sinker is a very good writer. Here he writes about the KKK in the 1920s
    and 1930s and the resistance to them, drawing parallels with the current
    political climate. Well worth reading.

## Games

- [V Rising - Invaders of Oakveil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcJEuU6TJcQ)

    I've been playing V Rising since its initial release and Stunlock has been
    doing a great job with the expansions. This one also looks like it will not
    disappoint. Very much looking forward to giving it a go at the end of the
    month.
