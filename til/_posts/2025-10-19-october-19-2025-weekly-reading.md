## Career

- [You have 12 shots in life](https://jessyio.substack.com/p/shots) -- _Jessy_

    A thoughtful framework for thinking about career strategy using the concept of
    "shots". I've heard this expressed before using the term "projects" but it's
    basically the same.

    The idea is that since you have a career of roughly 50 years, and each major
    opportunity takes about 4 years to materialize, you have about 12 major
    opportunities in your career to create meaningful work.

    The reason that the "shots" terminology works is that each opportunity is not
    guaranteed to succeed. You have to take a shot, and most of the time you miss.
    You might end up with only 1 or 2 really big successes in your career.

    Jessy suggests using the 天地人 framework -- timing (天), place (地), and people
    (人) -- to evaluate each opportunity. This is fine, but there are probably a
    million ways to do this.

    The main takeaway is to be strategic about your career, don't waste time,
    and take lots of shots.

- [The illegible nature of software development talent](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/10/08/the-illegible-nature-of-software-development-talent/) -- _Lorin Hochstein_

    The idea here is that software engineering talent is often "illegible" in the
    sense that they aren't visible on social media or GitHub, but are still highly
    skilled and effective engineers.

    This mostly talks about it from the perspective of hiring, and how companies may
    miss out on great talent because they don't have a good way of really
    identifying strong performers during the hiring process.

    I have definitely seen this in practice at Google where many of the truly
    amazing engineers there didn't have much of an online presence. I suspect this
    is because they don't _need_ to have an online presence. When you are that good,
    your impact shows up well on paper without needing to embellish it.

## Vibe Engineering

- [Vibe Engineering](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/7/vibe-engineering/) -- _Simon Willison_

    Simon suggests we use the term "vibe engineering" to describe "vibe coding" in a
    more deliberate, strategic, and systematic way, using software development
    techniques to amplify the output and put in place guardrails to avoid mistakes.

    For example, automated tests, documentation, version control, and code reviews
    all can help ensure that the vibe coded software is high quality and
    maintainable.

    Like the Wall Street Journal article [_Why AI Will Widen the Gap Between
    Superstars and Everybody
    Else_](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/workplace/ai-workplace-tensions-what-to-do-c45f6b51),
    Simon thinks senior engineers are best positioned to leverage AI coding tools.
    That may make it harder for junior engineers but I'm not sure that this is a
    whole lot different from any other tool.
