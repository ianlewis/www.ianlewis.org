## Go

- [What's New In Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj80m-umOxs) - _Cameron Balahan, Marc Dougherty (Google)_

    A very basic presentation of new features in Go 1.24. It looks like it was
    done for Google I/O 2025 but it's not one of the in-person sessions. It
    covers the improvements to iterators, `json` package's new `omitzero`
    option, improvements to WASM targets, post-quantum cryptography,
    and performance improvements to Go maps via the [new Swiss Tables
    implementation](https://go.dev/blog/swisstable).

## Security

- [Domestic abuse victim data stolen in Legal Aid hack](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr5g4pv2l0o) - _Aoife Walsh & Graeme Baker (BBC News)_

    A hack of the Legal Aid Agency in the UK has resulted in the personal data
    of domestic abuse victims being stolen. The breach was discovered in
    April 2025. Stolen info apparently includes addresses, dates of birth,
    national ID numbers, criminal history, employment and financial data. It's
    terrible that the victims are some of the most vulnerable people.

## Artificial Intelligence

- [The Who Cares Era](https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-05-23-who-cares/) - _Dan Sinker_

    Dan Singer writes about how people don't care that what they read is true
    anymore. He argues that writers, editors, and readers just don't seem to
    care whether something is true or not as long it it's "good enough" and
    sounds plausible and that AI is a major cause. He also talks a bit about how
    using AI contributes to creating dumbed-down content that doesn't challenge
    readers to think critically.

    Just like with programming, it feels like folks who actually know the
    underlying skills and do the work will have an advantage over folks that
    just blindly use AI tools.
