I've added this new section to the site which will include short posts on things
that I've learned recently. I was inspired by [Simon Willison's TIL
site](https://til.simonwillison.net/)
([repository](https://github.com/simonw/til)), which was inspired by Josh
Branchaud's post "[How I Built a Learning
Machine](https://dev.to/jbranchaud/how-i-built-a-learning-machine-45k9)" (and
his TIL repository [`jbranchaud/til`](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til)), which
itself was inspired by the idea of "[Learn in
Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/)".

Hopefully, it will be a place where I can write down my thoughts to help them
solidify in my mind without too much overhead.
